    <pre>James are an English rock band from Manchester, 
        formed in 1982.[6] They achieved popularity during the 1990s,
         with four top-10 hits on the UK Singles Chart and nine top-10 placings on the UK Albums Chart.[7] 
         The band's best-known singles include "Come Home", "Sit Down", "She's a Star" and "Laid".[8]
          "Laid" also became a hit on American college radio. Following the departure of lead singer Tim Booth in 2001,
           the band became inactive, but members reunited in January 2007 and have since released a further seven albums. 
           Live performance has continually remained a central part of the band's output.[9] As of 2010, 
           the band had sold more than 25 million albums worldwide.[10]</pre>
